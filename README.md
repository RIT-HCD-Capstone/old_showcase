Digital Humanities at RIT: DHSS
The Digital Humanities and Social Sciences BS (DHSS) engages students with a diversity of work. Participating in both traditional and interdisciplinary, hands-on, project-based courses, students will develop skills like critical thinking, cultural awareness, communication, and digital literacy.

The core of the DHSS curriculum includes basic programming and design principles alongside ethics and histories of technology and digital culture. The flexibility of the curriculum is welcoming to newcomers, transfers, major changes, and double majors, and students can easily curate their courses to meet their career aspirations.

For example, students can specialize in

Creative Writing
Digital Journalism / Literature
Web Development
Communications
Game Design & Development
International and Global Studies
And more
Additional information:

DHSS is listed as one of RITâ€™s New Economy Majors.

Why the DHSS Showcase?
The DHSS Showcase is a living document of Digital Humanities at RIT. Being both representative and interactive, its purpose is to provide visibility to an evolving and increasingly relevant discipline.

Specifically, the DHSS Showcase exists to help

celebrate and connect the efforts and interests of DHSS faculty and students 
create community and growth
inform empirical understandings of DH
educate prospective students and educators
create and archive shared knowledge built by and for collaboration
With a digital presence that embodies the values of DH, we believe DHSS is empowered.
