# DHSS Showcase

## Digital Humanities at RIT: DHSS
Digital Humanities and Social Sciences BS (DHSS) is one of RIT's "New Economy Majors", representing skillsets looked for by employers in todays technology-focused world. Students will develop both "hard" (technical) and "soft" (social) skills through a combination of interdisciplinary coursework. Hands-on, project-based courses enabling students to show off their skills are a major focus of the major.

The core of the DHSS curriculum includes programming and design principles coupled with the history of technology and digital culture. The flexibility offered by this degree is welcoming to newcomers, transfers, major changes, and double majors, and students will find it easy to curate their courses to fit their career aspirations.

Students can specialize in:
 - Creative Writing
 - Digital Journalism / Literature
 - Web Development
 - Communications
 - Game Design & Development
 - International and Global Studies
 - And more!

## Why the DHSS Showcase?
The DHSS Showcase is a living document of Digital Humanities at RIT. Being both representative and interactive, its purpose is to provide visibility to an evolving and increasingly relevant discipline.

Specifically, the DHSS Showcase exists to help:
 - celebrate and connect the efforts and interests of DHSS faculty and students 
 - create community and growth
 - inform empirical understandings of DH
 - educate prospective students and educators
 - create and archive shared knowledge built by and for collaboration
 - With a digital presence that embodies the values of DH, we believe DHSS is empowered.

## What is Digital Humanities?
Digital Humanities (DH) is a collaborative effort to...
 - …advance the humanities in a networked world
 - …inform the development and treatment of tech and media by the humanities and vice versa
 - …study and apply accessibility, inclusion, and sustainability
 - …foster new forms of inquiry
 - …develop those efforts from each other
 - …and improve DH

## How to contribute:

The RIT DHSS Showcase's source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/dhss-showcase-rit/showcase), on [GitHub](https://github.com). Currently, the site is built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org), using the [Commons In A Box (CBOX)](https://commonsinabox.org) [OpenLab](https://commonsinabox.org/cbox-openlab-overview) toolkit. We have made several edits of our own to the included plugins in an attempt to better fit our needs.

In order to make changes to the code, you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com). There are also several GUI-based git clients like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/github-student-developer-pack-bundle) which are either free or offer student versions. Any of them will work.

Editing the code should be done on a local copy (on your machine). When looking at the GitHub repo, the green `code` button will give you everything you need to "clone" the code.

Using the git cli, all you need to do is copy and run the provided command, then follow the prompts on the command line. Using GitHub Desktop is even easier, taking only a single click to start the process.
